- command substitution should be valid at the beginning of the line too
- add subshell highlight
- and brace expansion
- add brackets to the main style without loss of the context
- pipes '|' should be in pipes' file color
- clean the code: get rid of unnecessary array, 
- bug: first command in the subshell and in the list `{}` should be highlighted

- nice feature: separate expansion flags from the parameter, like ${(kv)abc}

- biger challange: loop over nested sub-words (double quotes, command-, process-substitution, subshells).
