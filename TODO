- command substitution should be valid at the beginning of the line too
- add 'in' and ']]' to the reserved words set of colors
- add brackets to the main style without loss of the context
- clean the code: get rid of unnecessary array, 
- remove precommand style

- nice feature: separate expansion flags from the parameter, like ${(kv)abc}

- biger challange: loop over nested sub-words (double quotes, command-, process-substitution, subshells).
