- add 'in' to the reserved words set of colors
- clean the code: get rid of unnecessary arrays!
- remove precommand style
- add pattern highlight
- add special characters
- add many words highlighting in complex commands, like 'then' and 'elif' in if-fi.

- nice feature: separate expansion flags from the parameter, like ${(kv)abc}

- biger challange: loop over nested sub-words (double quotes, command-, process-substitution, subshells).
